# my-data-project
Basic data engineering project to explore end-to-end data pipelines, ETL and data visualisation.

## 1. Introduction

This is a basic data engineering project I used to familiarise myself with different data engineering tools. For a first project, I wanted to use elements I was already familiar with: tools I had prior knowledge and experience with, data I knew well and open-source platforms with low barriers for entry. The end result was this simple pipeline that uses API calls, JSON data, Pandas for data processing and Postgres for storage.
